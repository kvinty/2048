## About
This is a clone of 2048 game I wrote as an exercise in C++ and Qt. The interface is painted completely manually, using only QPainter.

## How to use
* Install C++ compiler and Qt library. For Debian-based GNU/Linux: `aptitude install g++ qt5-default`
* Run `qmake`
* Run `make`
* Run the binary (`./2048`)

## ToDo
* Some feartures such as animation, achievement history and multiple undo may be added, but I don't think they are really necessary.
